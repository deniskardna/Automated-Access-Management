# Automated-Access-Management

## introduction

Access package is a collection of resources that users need access to, bundled together for easier management. These resources can include applications, groups, and roles. Access packages simplify the process of granting access by allowing administrators to create predefined sets of permissions that can be assigned to users based on their attributes, such as department, role.
